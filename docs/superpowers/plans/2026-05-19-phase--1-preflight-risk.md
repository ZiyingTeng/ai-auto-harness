# Phase -1 Preflight And Risk Validation Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:executing-plans`. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Validate disk capacity and Claude Code runtime assumptions before platform development begins.

**Architecture:** This phase performs read-only measurement first, then writes small experiment scripts under `experiments/`. Destructive cleanup is manual-approval only.

**Tech Stack:** bash, Claude Code background shell behavior, filesystem inspection.

## Files

- Create: `/root/ai-auto-harness/experiments/R2-bg-shell-persistence.sh`
- Create: `/root/ai-auto-harness/experiments/R2-check.sh`
- Create: `/root/ai-auto-harness/experiments/R2-findings.md`
- Create: `/root/ai-auto-harness/experiments/R3-long-running-session.sh`
- Create: `/root/ai-auto-harness/experiments/R3-findings.md`

## Development Guidance

This phase is not application coding. It prepares the operational ground truth that later skills rely on:

- Whether long background downloads can outlive a Claude Code process.
- Whether `claude-haha --print` can survive long-running tasks.
- Whether there is enough disk for 10GB-100GB model experiments.

Keep all experiment artifacts small and committed. Do not commit runtime logs from `/tmp`.

## Test Setup

Run from:

```bash
cd /root/ai-auto-harness
```

Use these read-only probes first:

```bash
df -h /root
find /root -maxdepth 1 -name 'core.*' -type f -printf '%s %p\n' 2>/dev/null | sort -nr | head -20
du -sh /root/auto-deploy-agent/workspace/* 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -20
```

Expected:

- Disk free should be enough for at least one 30GB-80GB model test.
- Any cleanup recommendation is written down before deletion.

## Tasks

### Task -1.1: Disk Preflight

- [ ] Record `/root` disk usage with `df -h /root`.
- [ ] List large core files and large old workspaces.
- [ ] If cleanup is needed, ask for explicit approval before deleting anything.
- [ ] After approved cleanup, rerun `df -h /root`.
- [ ] Write the result into the phase notes or commit message.

Validation command:

```bash
df -h /root
```

Expected: available space is comfortably above the next planned model download.

### Task -1.2: R2 Background Shell Persistence

- [ ] Create `experiments/R2-bg-shell-persistence.sh`.
- [ ] Create `experiments/R2-check.sh`.
- [ ] Run the start script from a Claude Code session.
- [ ] Exit or interrupt the parent session according to the experiment instructions.
- [ ] Run the check script after at least 90 seconds.
- [ ] Write the outcome into `experiments/R2-findings.md`.

Validation command:

```bash
bash /root/ai-auto-harness/experiments/R2-check.sh
```

Expected: the findings file says whether `setsid nohup` survives the parent Claude Code process.

### Task -1.3: R3 Long Running Print Session

- [ ] Create `experiments/R3-long-running-session.sh`.
- [ ] Run it with the same Claude Code binary that cron will use.
- [ ] Record elapsed time and whether the process returns normally.
- [ ] Write the outcome into `experiments/R3-findings.md`.

Validation command:

```bash
test -s /root/ai-auto-harness/experiments/R3-findings.md
```

Expected: file exists and contains the final decision for using `--print` in cron.

## Commit

```bash
cd /root/ai-auto-harness
git add experiments/
git commit -m "ai-auto: add preflight risk experiments"
```

## Phase Acceptance

- [ ] Disk status is known.
- [ ] R2 findings are recorded.
- [ ] R3 findings are recorded.
- [ ] Later phases know whether they can depend on background shells or need a safer service wrapper.
